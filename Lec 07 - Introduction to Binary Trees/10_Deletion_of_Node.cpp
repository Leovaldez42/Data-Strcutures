/* PROBLEM: Given a binary tree, delete a node from it by making sure that tree 
            shrinks from the bottom (i.e. the deleted node is replaced by bottommost 
            and rightmost node).
        
    Delete 10 in below tree:
           10
         /    \         
        20     30
    Output:    
           30
         /             
        20     


    Delete 20 in below tree:
           10
         /    \         
        20     30
                \
                40
    Output :    
           10
         /   \             
        40    30   
            
    APPROACH:
        1. Starting at root, find the deepest and rightmost node in binary tree and node 
            which we want to delete.
        2. Replace the deepest rightmost node’s data with node to be deleted.
        3. Then delete the deepest rightmost node.
    
    Note: 
        We can also replace node’s data that is to be deleted with any node whose 
        left and right child points to NULL but we only use deepest node in order to maintain 
        the balance of a binary tree.
