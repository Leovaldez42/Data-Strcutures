/*
    The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest 
    path between two end nodes.

    Basic observation:
    The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:
    a) the diameter of T’s left subtree
    b) the diameter of T’s right subtree
    c) the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T 
       (this can be computed from the heights of the subtrees of T)
    
    The code of above implementation is:
    
        int diameter (Node* root) {
            if (tree == NULL)   return 0;

            int l_height = height(tree->left);
            int r_height = height(tree->right);

            int l_diameter = diameter(tree->left);
            int r_diameter = diameter(tree->right);

            return max(l_height+r_height+1, max(l_diameter, r_diameter));
        }
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)

    Here is another way to think about diameter of tree:
    Diameter of a tree can be calculated by only using the height function, 
    because the diameter of a tree is nothing but maximum value of 
    (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node. So we need to calculate 
    this value (left_height + right_height + 1) for each node and 
    update the result. 

    Time Complexity: O(n)
