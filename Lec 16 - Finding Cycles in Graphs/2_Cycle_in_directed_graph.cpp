/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not.

    SOLUTION:
    DFS can be used to detect cycle in a graph. There is a cycle in a graph,
    only if there is a 'backedge' present in the graph. A back edge is an 
    edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestor 
    in the tree produced by DFS.

    To detect a back edge, we can keep track of vertices currently in recursion 
    stack of function for DFS traversal. If we reach a vertex that is already 
    in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that 
    connects current vertex to the vertex in the recursion stack is a back edge. 
    We have used recStack[] array to keep track of vertices in the recursion stack.
